The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.
Example:
marks key:value pairs are:
'alpha' :[20,30,40]
'beta':[30,50,70]
query_name = 'beta'

The query_name is 'beta', beta's average score is (30 + 50 + 70)/3 = 50.0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    student_marks = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        name, *line = input().split()
        scores = list(map(float, line))
        student_marks[name] = scores
    query_name = input()
    mark = 0
    for i in student_marks[query_name]:
        mark = mark + i 
    average_mark = mark / 3
    print("%.2f" % average_mark)
