Task
The provided code stub reads and integer, , from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i2 .

Example

The list of non-negative integers that are less than n=3  is [0,1,2]. Print the square of each number on a separate line.

0
1
4
Input Format

The first and only line contains the integer, .

Constraints
1<= n <=20

Output Format

Print n lines, one corresponding to each i .

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    
i = 0
while i < n:
    print(i*i)
    i += 1
  
  
Print Function
The included code stub will read an integer n, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
123....n

Note that "" represents the consecutive values in between.

Example
n = 5
Print the string 12345.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer .
Constraints
1<= n <= 150

Output Format

Print the list of integers from  through  as a string, without spaces.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    
result = ''
i = 0
while i < n:
    i += 1
    result = result + str(i)
print(result)
